Jimmy Bogard ([MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)).
Jimmy is an amazing developer and a knowledge sharer.  
Through his course at [11x Engineering](https://11xengineering.com/),
his many blog posts on Los Techies and now [JimmyBogard.com](https://jimmybogard.com/).
I have learned great amounts.

Peter Morris (Fluxor). Pete and I
have been friends for many years and he is an amazing developer and person who has taught me much.
Not surprisingly Pete and I think much alike.
We independently started working on our State Management
libraries. Although I started first :P (By like a few days)
Pete's component attempts to solve most of the same problems.
TimeWarp.State draws on the strengths of a proven async pipeline in MediatR where as Fluxor
implements its own middle-ware.  
If TimeWarp.State does not meet your needs be sure to checkout Fluxor.
