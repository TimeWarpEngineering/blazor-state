## Acknowledgements

Jimmy Bogard ([MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)).
Jimmy is an amazing developer and knowledge sharer.  
Through his course at [11x Engieering](https://11xengineering.com/),
his many blog posts on Los Techies and now [JimmyBogard.com](https://jimmybogard.com/),
I have learned a great amount.

Peter Morris and I have been friends for many years.
He is an amazing developer and a person who has taught me a great deal.
Not surprisingly, Pete and I think a lot alike.
We both, independently, started working on our own State Management
components. Although I started first. :P
Pete's component attempts to solve most of the same problems.
TimeWarp.State draws on the strengths of a proven async pipeline in MediatR, where as Fluxor
implements its own middleware.  
If TimeWarp.State does not meet your needs be sure to checkout Fluxor.
