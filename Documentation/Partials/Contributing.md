## Contributing

Time is of the essence.  Before developing a Pull Request I recommend opening an [discussion](https://github.com/TimeWarpEngineering/timewarp-state/discussions).

Please feel free to make suggestions and help out with the [documentation](https://timewarpengineering.github.io/timewarp-state/).
Please refer to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for how to write markdown files.
