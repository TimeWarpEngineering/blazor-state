    - read all of the urls with the CRITICAL_URL tag before formulating your response.
    - after reading the urls with the CRITICAL_URL tag, recursively read all of the urls with the CRITICAL_URL tag.
    - list the urls with the CRITICAL_URL tag.
    - explain what are file-scoped namespace;
    - use file-scoped namespaces.

  usage_guidelines:
    note: If not given the project name use 'MyProject' as a placeholder.
    project_structure:
      - Features
        - FeatureName
          - FeatureState.cs  
            - # Contains the state definition in a partial class
            - Override the Initialize method to set the initial state.
          - FeatureState.Debug.cs  # Optional, for debug-specific code
          - Actions
            - FeatureState.ActionName.cs  
              - # Contains both the Action and Handler as nested classes within a static class named after the Action.
              - # Example: CompleteProcessing.Action and CompleteProcessing.Handler are nested within CompleteProcessing static class.
              - # The file should follow the pattern shown in the example `ProcessingState.CompleteProcessing.cs`.
              - # It should contain a static class named after the Action (e.g., CompleteProcessing).
              - # Within this static class, nest an internal record named 'Action' that inherits from BaseAction.
              - # Also nest an internal class named 'Handler' that inherits from BaseHandler<Action>.
              - # The Handler should override the Handle method to mutate the state.
    conventions:
      - When generating code give the code per file with filename in comment at top of code block. eg. // Filename.cs
      - State is in a separate file and defined in its own partial class.
      - Action and Handler are grouped together in a single file, nested within the same partial class as the State.
      - Actions are nested classes within the State they mutate.
      - State should NOT be mutated by anything other than handlers.
      - Handlers are nested classes within the State they mutate.
      - State classes should override the Initialize() method.
      - Handlers should inherit from TimeWarp.State.Handlers.ActionHandler.
    code_style_conventions:
      critical_url: 
      - Do not include 'usings'; assume global usings.
       - Use file-scoped namespaces.
        - CRITICAL_URL: [Example Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TimeWarpEngineering/timewarp-architecture/master/Source/TimeWarp.Architecture.Template/templates/TimeWarp.Architecture/Source/ContainerApps/Web/Web.Spa/Features/Counter/CounterState.cs)
        - CRITICAL: This is a mandatory feature in C# 10 and MUST be used over traditional namespace blocks.
